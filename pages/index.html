## OVERVIEW

Design Expo is an eight-week design challenge — seven weeks during the semester, and one after. Students will work in groups to understand, and then respond to, a brief from Microsoft Research (MSR), and then present their work for feedback and iteration. Each week will also feature guest presenters from the likes of Google, Microsoft, Kickstarter, and more.

This year's theme is "Achieving Symbiosis and the Conversational User Interface (CUI)," and allows for a wide variety of interpretations. Given the scale and range of the topic, it will be critical for students to focus in on a particular community, type of interface, and problem that has impact. Students will form their own small groups of 3-5 people (before applying), and each group will research the challenge, propose possible innovations or solutions, and then iterate those proposals. A successful proposal can be a demo ("We've imagined a new possibility, and this is what it would look like") or a prototype ("We've imagined a new possibility, and we built a small version of it.")

At the end of the workshop one group will be selected by outside reviewers to travel to Redmond, WA in July to present their proposal at MSR's Faculty Research Summit along with other students from top institutions around the world.

This workshop will run from 9:30-12 for seven sessions, and will meet for one additional session in July, prior to the trip to Microsoft.


## COMPENSATION

Design Expo is an extra-curricular workshop. As such, accepted groups will be awarded a small research stipend, pending a successful completion of the program.


## SPECIFICATIONS

Students will submit their proposals as a group by February 8th, and selected groups will be notified of their acceptance by February 12th.


## ASSIGNMENTS

The majority of the assigments given for this workshop are group-oriented, and focus on the definition, evolution, and presentation of each team's concepts. As such, each group should come prepared to not only discuss the assignments each week, but to give updates on the progression of their projects.

While most readings are available online and/or will be distributed by the instructor, the following text is required:

- [The Glass Cage: How Our Computers Are Changing Us by Nicholas Carr](http://amzn.com/0393351637)

The following texts offer great insights into the the subject matter, and are recommended, though not required:

- [Smarter Than You Think: How Technology Is Changing Our Minds for the Better](http://amzn.com/B00C5R7AJK), Clive Thompson
- [The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size](http://amzn.com/0140230122), Tor Norretranders
- [Pitch Perfect: How to Say It Right the First Time, Every Time](http://amzn.com/B00DB3A4VS), Bill McGowan
